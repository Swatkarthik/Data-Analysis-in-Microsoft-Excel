About this project For the Maven Northwind Challenge, I am working with Microsoft Excel for Northwind Traders, 
a global import and export company that specializes in supplying high-quality gourmet food products to restaurants,
cafes, and specialty food retailers around the world.I have created this dashboard, which will give a quick 
understanding to the manager about the company's performance in key areas, including:

Sales trends
Employee performance
Key countries
Shipping costs

Insights & Recommendations
1.The sales trend clearly shows that over the period it has grown, but there is huge decline in sales 
from April 2015 to May 2015. The forecast for the next 6 months shows steady growth.
2.The top 3 categories are Beverages (21.15%), Dairy Products (18.56%) and Meat & Poultry (13.16%) which
 provided almost 53% of the total sales of the company. 
3.QUICK STOP of Germany, SAVE- A -LOT MARKETS of USA and ERNST HANDEL of Austria are the key customers 
in general results. Managing and expanding the relation with them can give huge profits in the long 
run to the company, as they provide a big income.
4.Company products shipment is mostly done through the United Package Company compared to Federal shipping and Speedy Recovery
5.Overall Margaret Peacock is the Top employee who did the sales about $275,000 
6.ERNSH, QUICK & SAVEA are the 3 Top Customes for the company
